This repository accompanies the journal paper "A Socio-Technical Approach to Load Forecasting for Super Smart Grids: A Multi-domain Attention-Based Neural Network." It contains the processed data and source code with model architectures

Overview
The paper proposes a deep learning model that integrates socioeconomic, temporal, and electrical features for multi-zonal load forecasting. Using a multi-domain attention-based neural network, the approach improves both predictive accuracy and model interpretability for applications in super smart grids.

Purpose
This repository is made available for reproducibility and data availability purposes. It is intended to support readers, reviewers, and fellow researchers in replicating and understanding the methods presented in the paper.
